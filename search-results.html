<!-- On page load, if there are query parameters, immediately parse them and use them in a request URL to fetch data from the Library of Congress API. -->



<!-- If there is a value for the format query parameter, use the format endpoint to search for something based on the chosen format. -->



<!-- If there is no value for the format query parameter, use the search endpoint to search for all types of data.  -->



<!-- The response from the API request will then be displayed on the page. -->



<!-- The same form from the homepage should be here as well. Instead of redirecting a user to another page, however, it will perform a search right on the page and display the new results. -->
